# PLS_of_Clinical_Trials

### Abstract
Communicating the findings of clinical trials to a broad audience is often hindered by complex, technical language, making it 
difficult for patients and non-experts to understand. This thesis addresses this challenge by developing a new dataset of 286 
clinical trials paired with their plain language summaries, aimed at bridging the gap between complex medical reports and 
public comprehension. This dataset serves as a foundation for initial evaluations of machine learning models, including a 
fine-tuned DistilBERT and the Mistral-7B-Instruct model, to explore how effectively they can generate simplified, accessible 
summaries. The study provides an initial assessment of the models' performance, highlighting both their potential in 
improving the readability of clinical information and the challenges such as model accuracy and hallucination. These early 
results point toward future improvements and refinements in using machine learning for plain language summarization in 
healthcare communication.
